Objective of this test plan is to define various Testing strategies and testing tools used for complete Testing lifecycle of this project.
3.	SCOPE
This document specifies about the GUI testing in various platforms and also the requirement specified.
3.1	Functions to be tested.
-	Web app
-	Mobile app
-	API
-	How to improve the UI/UX
-	How the app fares when the connectivity is low
4.	REFERENCES
Test details provided by the client. Refer the specified location -

-	Verify requirement specification document
-	QA will prepare understanding document
-	Check with immediate team for any queries (QA leads. DEV team)
-	Raise query to the client
-	Response will be sent by the client
5.2	Test case preparation
-	Prepare test cases based on the requirement
-	Test cases will cover all the requirements specified
5.3	Test matrix
-	A Test matrix will be prepared which will map the test cases with the requirements.
-	Test matrix will help in test coverage
5.4	Review	
-	Test cases and test matrix will be reviewed by Senior QA members and DEV team can also be involved in the review
-	Reviewers will provide comments and suggestions for the test cases and test coverage
-	Comments and suggestions should be reworked and added in the test cases
-	Re-work and improvements will be reviewed and approved by the reviewers
5.5	Test data Creation
-	QA will prepare the test data based on the requirement
5.6	Test Execution
-	A Test matrix will be prepared which will map the test cases with the requirements.
-	Test matrix will help in test coverage
5.6.1	Defect logging and Reporting
-	Will be done in JIRA or BUGZILLA
5.6.2	Retesting and Regression Testing
-	Retesting the fixed bugs will be part of new builds and once the final build is deployed few rounds of regression testing will be executed to ensure the correctness of the flow.
